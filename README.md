ReactJS Interview Question and Answers

1. What is react.js?
   React is an open-source Javascript library developed for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.

2. What are the major features of react?
   Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
   JSX: JSX stands for Javascript and XML, which allow writing HTML in React components.
   Components: React is Component-based, meaning the UI is built using reusable components.
   One-way Data Binding: Data flows in one direction, making the application easier to understand and debug.
   High Performance: React Optimizes updates by using a virtual DOM and efficently re-rendering components.
   Undirectional Data Flow: Data flows in a single direction, which provides better control over the entire application.

3. What is Virtual DOM and how it works?

Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React Components.
React keeps a copy of the actual DOM structure in memory, called the virtual DOM, and uses it to optimize updates and rendering.

Rendering -----> Updating ----> Diffing Algorithm -----> Batch Updates -----> Reconciliation

4. What are components in react?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently.
Class Based Components 
Functional Components

5. Explain Class components with example?

class nameofComponent extends component then render method return JSX.

import React, {Component} from 'react;
class ClassComponentExample extends Component {
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello</h1>;
    }
}
export default ClassComponentExample;

4. Explain functional components with example?

2-ways

import React from 'react';

function FunctionalComponent() { // function keyword
    return <h1>Hello</h1>
}
export default FunctionalComponent;

import React from 'react';
const FunctionalComponent = () => { //const arrow function
    return <h1>hello</h1>
}
export default FunctionalComponent;

5. What is JSX?
JSX stands for Javascript XML.
It allows us to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM without using methods like createElement() or appendChild().

6. How to export and import components?
we can export components using export default or named exports, and import them using import.
inorder to reuse a component we need to export.

exportcomponent1.js

import react from "react";

const Home = () =>{
    return <h1>Home!</h1>;
};

export default Home;


=================

importcomponent1.js

import React from "react";
import Home from "./home";

const App = () =>{
    return (
        <div>
        <Home />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

7. How to use nested components?
